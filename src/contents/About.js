<p> Since I first understood what computers were, I knew that this was the area to go
I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age,
now Iâ€™m 20 years old, Pursuing my Software Engineering Degree in
VIT University Vellore.  Web development is my center of interest, i always
love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n one code base deploy into almost
any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables me to do. I also like
creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those desgin and codes
to the world through Github, Codepen and Instagram.......
